### Approach 1: Analyze Sentence by Sentence, Update Knowledge Graph and Check for Ambiguity Simultaneously

```python
# Pseudocode for Approach 1

# Load the Llama model
model = load_llama_model()

# Initialize the Knowledge Graph
knowledge_graph = initialize_knowledge_graph()

for sentence in document_sentences:
    # Process the sentence to extract entities and relationships
    entities, relationships = model.extract_entities_and_relationships(sentence)
    
    # Update the knowledge graph with extracted entities and relationships
    knowledge_graph.add(entities, relationships)
    
    # Analyze the sentence for ambiguity
    ambiguity_checks = model.analyze_ambiguity(sentence)
    
    # Update the knowledge graph or take action based on ambiguity analysis
    if ambiguity_checks.indicate_ambiguity():
        # Take necessary action to resolve or note the ambiguity
        knowledge_graph.update_based_on_ambiguity(ambiguity_checks)
    
    # Optionally, output or log the analysis of the sentence
    log_analysis(sentence, entities, relationships, ambiguity_checks)

# After processing all sentences
# The knowledge graph is now updated and ambiguities addressed simultaneously
visualize_knowledge_graph(knowledge_graph)
```

### Approach 2: Analyze Sentence by Sentence and Update Knowledge Graph, Then Analyze Ambiguity

```python
# Pseudocode for Approach 2

# Load the Llama model
model = load_llama_model()

# Initialize the Knowledge Graph
knowledge_graph = initialize_knowledge_graph()

# First pass: Analyze each sentence and update the knowledge graph
for sentence in document_sentences:
    # Process the sentence to extract entities and relationships
    entities, relationships = model.extract_entities_and_relationships(sentence)
    
    # Update the knowledge graph with extracted entities and relationships
    knowledge_graph.add(entities, relationships)
    
    # Optionally, log the analysis of the sentence
    log_analysis(sentence, entities, relationships)

# Second pass: Now that the knowledge graph is built, analyze each sentence for ambiguity
for sentence in document_sentences:
    # Analyze the sentence for ambiguity, with context from the knowledge graph
    ambiguity_checks = model.analyze_ambiguity_with_context(sentence, knowledge_graph)
    
    # Update the knowledge graph or take action based on the new ambiguity analysis
    if ambiguity_checks.indicate_ambiguity():
        # Take necessary action to resolve or note the ambiguity
        knowledge_graph.update_based_on_ambiguity(ambiguity_checks)
        
    # Optionally, log the ambiguity analysis of the sentence
    log_ambiguity_analysis(sentence, ambiguity_checks)

# After processing all sentences in both passes,
# The knowledge graph is now fully updated and ambiguities analyzed
visualize_knowledge_graph(knowledge_graph)
```
